Because this my first website I have a decent amount ideas but I don't think
the website will come out that great in my honest opinion but I guess I can make
a portfolio/folder with all the work that i want to put in there so if people like it
They can click on it and buy it.I'm going to make sure all the music I put on the site is
copyrighted so no one can try and still my beats without paying for it.

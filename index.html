    <h1>All about articles</h1>
    <h2>The Indefinite Article</h2>
    <p>The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?” Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item. “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie. Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns. Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in context:

    <strong>Please</strong> hand me a book; any book will do.
     Please hand me an autobiography; any autobiography will do.</p>
     <h2>Exceptions: Choosing A or An</h2>
    <p>There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using a before words that start with consonants and an before words that begin with vowels. The first letter of the word honor, for example, is a consonant, but it’s unpronounced. In spite of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, we use an. Consider the example sentence below for an illustration of this concept.

     My mother is a honest woman.
     My mother is an <b>honest woman.</b>
     Similarly, when the first letter of a word is a vowel but is pronounced with a consonant sound, use a, as in the sample sentence below:

     She is an <em>United States senator.</em>
     She is a United States senator.
     This holds true with acronyms and <i>nitialisms, too:</i> an LCD display, a UK-based company, an HR department, a URL.</p>
